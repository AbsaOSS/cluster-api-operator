# Cluster API Operator

## âœ¨ What is Cluster API Operator?

The **Cluster API Operator** is a Kubernetes Operator designed to empower cluster administrators to handle the lifecycle of Cluster API providers within a management cluster using a declarative approach. It aims to improve user experience in deploying and managing Cluster API, making it easier to handle day-to-day tasks and automate workflows with GitOps. 

This operator leverages a declarative API and extends the capabilities of the `clusterctl` CLI, allowing greater flexibility and configuration options for cluster administrators.
